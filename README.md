# Hi, I'm Vidhathri 👋  

I work as a **DevOps Engineer**, building and running cloud infrastructure that has to be fast, reliable, and secure.  
Most of my time goes into **automation, containerization, and CI/CD pipelines** — basically making sure that code can move from developer laptops into production with as little friction as possible.

## 🛠️ What I Work With
- **Cloud**: Azure and AWS (occasional GCP work)  
- **CI/CD**: Azure DevOps, Jenkins, GitHub Actions  
- **IaC**: Terraform, Bicep, ARM, CloudFormation  
- **Containers**: Docker, Kubernetes (AKS, EKS, OpenShift), Helm  
- **Monitoring**: Dynatrace, Grafana, Prometheus, Datadog, ELK  
- **Scripting**: Python, PowerShell, Bash

## 📌 A Few Things I’ve Done
- Set up **end-to-end pipelines** with automated build, test, and deploy for .NET, Java, and Python applications.  
- Built **Terraform modules** to spin up multi-tier environments in both Azure and AWS.  
- Migrated on-prem workloads into **AKS and EKS clusters**, containerizing apps with Docker and Helm.  
- Integrated **Prometheus/Grafana** and **Dynatrace** for cluster and app monitoring, adding alerts for real-time failure detection.  
- Automated repetitive admin tasks with **PowerShell and Ansible playbooks** to save hours of manual work.

💡 *Most of my client work is private, but I’ve summarized my approach and experience in the [Wiki section]([https://github.com/Vidhathriasani/Vidhathri.wiki.git]). That’s where I break down the pipelines, infrastructure, and monitoring setups I’ve worked on.*
